Library

Imagine you have an own library and you want a site to see what books you have, how many are taken, the status, history etc.

Follow current technology stack:
Ruby 2.4, Rails 5+, Mysql/PostreSQL/MongoDB(mongo is preferred), Bootstrap, Rspec.
  Pages should not be 'responsive', just make them look nice on mobile devices.

# What should you do

1. Books page. The list with all the books, 20 per page. Shows basic info:

    * Image
    * Book name - this is a link to book /show page.
    * Author
    * Status (status can be in/out). If status is out then display user name who took a book.
    * Edit, delete and create new book.
    Top 5 books based on likes count and taken count. Top books are displayed regardless of pagination.
    
2. Book page. Verbose information about a book.

    * Image
    * Name
    * Description
    * Likes counter
    * Author
    * Status
    * Comments
    * History    
    
    History includes: name of user who took a book, when book has been taked, when returned back.    
    User allowed to comment, edit, delete, like, take or return a book.

# Will be a huge plus but not necessary:
	* Test coverage with rspec.
	* Respond with json. Serializers are preferred.
	* Bootstrap components like modal windows, panels etc. including mobile and desktop grid.
	* Delete, take, return, like book without page reloading.
	* Book rating (any formula)
